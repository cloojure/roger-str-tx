                         as well as expected since its debut last year. Apple sold 77.3 million
                         iPhones in the final quarter of 2017, below analystsΓÇÖ projections of 80.2
                         million units.  Some consumers were turned off by the iPhone XΓÇÖs $1,000
                         price despite liking the design even as they wanted something more
                         cutting-edge than the cheaper iPhone 8. With its next lineup, Apple is
                         seeking to rekindle sales by offering a model for everyone.<p>This seems
                         like color commentary that isn&#x27;t supported by their sources, or data.
                         I&#x27;m not sure how they are supporting this statement. Apple&#x27;s
                         recent quarterly earnings [0] showed iPhone sales as (essentially) stable,
                         year over year. ASP increased to $800 dollars (!) which would point to the
                         iPhone X doing relatively well, despite not being available for the entire
                         quarter.<p>Even beyond that, there is no way for Apple to begin product
                         development at a point <i>after</i> they saw the Q4 results. There is far
                         to much lead-time required for them to be able to wait until now to do
                         so.<p>My guess is that 1) the rumors of these 2 new models are true, 2)
                         Apple committed to this product roadmap a long time ago, and 3) Bloomberg
                         is adding it&#x27;s own spin to make the leaks more salacious.<p>[0] - <a
